# Introduction

**Nim** is a statically-typed, high-level programming languages. 
It combines the performance of low-level languages like C and C++ with the expressiveness of high-level languages like Python.

It's a relatively recent language and was created in 2014.
The first feature we notice when we look at code in this language is it's Python-inspired syntax, but it also has automatic memory management with the use of ARC ([[Automatic Reference Counting]]), powerful compile-time meta programming through **AST-based (Abstract Syntax Tree)** macros, cross-compilation support and built-in concurrency mechanisms.

It's suitable for systems programming, general-purpose programming, scripting, game development and scientific computing.

**Nim** is often characterized by its Efficiency, Expressiveness and Elegance:
- **Nim** generates native, dependency-free executables that do not rely on a virtual machine, enabling compact size and effortless redistribution.
- The **Nim** compiler and its generated executables are compatible with all major platforms, including Windows, Linux and macOS.
- **Nim**'s memory management, inspired by C++ and Rust, is deterministic and customizable with destructors and move semantics, making it well-suited for embedded, hard-realtime systems.
- Modern concepts such as zero-overhead iterators and compile-time evaluation of user-defined functions, coupled with a preference for value-based datatypes allocated on the stack, result in highly performed code.
- **Nim** supports various backends, compiling to C, C++ or JavaScript (ew), making it an ideal choice for both backend and frontend needs.
- **Nim** is self-contained, as both the compiler and the standard library are implemented in **Nim** itself.
- With a powerful macro system, **Nim** allows direct manipulation of the **AST**, providing nearly limitless possibilities.
- **Nim** features a modern type system, complete with local type inference, tuples, generics and sum types.

# Features

**Nim** boasts several key features that make it an attractive language for developers:
- **Statically typed**: Type checking is performed at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors
- **High-level syntax**: **Nim**'s syntax is clean, concise and expressive, drawing inspiration from languages like Python and Haskell
- **Memory management**: **Nim** offers multiple automatic memory management strategies. Traditional garbage collection (--mm:refc) can be optionally substituted with a fully deterministic, destructor-based memory management (--mm:arc, --mm:orc), which circumvents common GC issues such as execution pauses and increased executable size due to the GC runtime system.ORC memory management operates effectively even with cyclic data structures and serves as default option for **Nim**. Traditional GC remains available, and manual memory management is also possible.
- **Meta programming**: allows for powerful compile-time meta programming through its macro system, enabling developers to write generic, reusable code.
- **Cross-compilation**: supports cross-compilation, making it possible to compile code for different platforms and architectures
- **Performance**: compiles to C, C++ and JavaScript, resulting in high-performance executables that rival the speed of native C and C++ applications
- **Concurrency**: provides built-in support for parallel and concurrent programming with its async/await and parallel statement features
